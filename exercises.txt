*Exercises*

For the following situations, determine which search approach to use and why would you take that approach. Write your answers in the submission box below.


1. Performing a search of a sorted by name IRS database for a taxpayer name

	I would use the searching functionality built into an ORM because the system already contains efficient search algorithms. 

2. Searching through an unsorted list containing the days of the weekend

	I would use an iterative search method because it would efficiently search through a small data set. 

3. Given a list of the planets in the Milky Way in ascending order by size, search for a planet with a given size.

	I would use a binary search since the list of planets is sorted and a binary search is faster than a iterative search. 

4. Searching for a checkpoint name in an unsorted list of Bloc checkpoints

	I would use an iterative search since the list of Bloc checkpoints is unsorted.
